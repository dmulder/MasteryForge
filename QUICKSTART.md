# MasteryForge Quick Start Guide for Homeschool Parents

This guide will help you get MasteryForge running in under 5 minutes!

## Step 1: Install Docker

First, you need Docker installed on your computer:

- **Windows**: Download from [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- **Mac**: Download from [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- **Linux**: Run `sudo apt-get install docker.io` (Ubuntu/Debian) or see [Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

After installing, make sure Docker is running (you should see a whale icon in your system tray).

## Step 2: Build the Image

The image is not published yet, so you need to build it locally.

### On Mac/Linux:
```bash
docker build -t masteryforge -f Dockerfile .
```

### On Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
docker build -t masteryforge -f Dockerfile .
```

## Step 3: Run MasteryForge

Open a terminal/command prompt and run:

### On Mac/Linux:
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name masteryforge \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v ~/masteryforge-data:/app/data \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  masteryforge
```

### On Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
docker run -d `
  --name masteryforge `
  -p 8000:8000 `
  -v C:\masteryforge-data:/app/data `
  --restart unless-stopped `
  masteryforge
```

Wait about 30 seconds for it to start up.

## Daily Use Tips

1. **Students**: Have them login each day and work on their recommended concepts
2. **Check Progress**: Login as parent weekly to see how everyone is doing
3. **Watch Frustration**: High frustration scores (above 0.7) mean your child needs help
4. **Celebrate Mastery**: When mastery hits 0.7 or higher, they've mastered that concept!
5. **Regular Backups**: Copy your data folder once a week to a safe location

Happy homeschooling! 🎓
